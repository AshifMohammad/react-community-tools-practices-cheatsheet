## Description

Redux focuses on making state updates predictable and traceable, with inspiration from the "Flux Architecture" pattern and Functional Programming principles.  It relies on separating descriptions of "what happened", called "actions", from the logic that decides how state should be updated, called "reducer functions".  Redux centralizes global application state into a single "store", and provides browser DevTools to view the history of state changes over time.
