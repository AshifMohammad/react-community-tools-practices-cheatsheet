## Description

XState builds on time-tested Computer Science patterns for defining and executing Finite State Machines and Statecharts, including interacting between those machines using the Actor Model.  XState enables defining specific known possible states for a system, how different events cause transitions between those states, and what side effects are executed as a result. It has the ability to visualize state machines and their transitions graphically.
